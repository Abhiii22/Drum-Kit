# Drum-Kit
"I created an interactive drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web app allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on virtual drum pads or pressing corresponding keyboard keys. Each pad triggers a unique sound (like kick, snare, or cymbal) and features visual feedback (animations or highlights) when activated. The project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event listeners (click/keypress), and audio handling in JavaScript, with a responsive and stylish UI designed with CSS."
